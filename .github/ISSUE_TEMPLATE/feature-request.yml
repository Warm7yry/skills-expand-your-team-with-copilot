        ## Implementation Hints
        - Consider how this feature fits with the existing system architecture
        - Look at similar existing functionality for patterns to follow
        - Frontend files are in `src/static/` directory
        - Backend API routes are in `src/backend/routers/`
        - Database operations use MongoDB via `src/backend/database.py`
        - Ensure new features work for both authenticated and non-authenticated users as appropriate
        - Consider security implications and input validation
        - Test the feature thoroughly with different user scenarios
        - Update any relevant documentation
